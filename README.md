# Weather-App
An app that uses your geolocation and external api to present the user with the current,hourly and weekly temperature.
Made using JavaScript,HTMl and CSS. I do not claim ownership of this code. This is open-source code. Recreated from u/WebDevSimplified`s JavaScript Weather App project.
